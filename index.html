                <p>I am a 1st year student at MNNIT Allahabad in CSE department. I am pursuing to improve my skills in coding of different languages in order to build apps and websites which can be used for good
                    I have a great interest in studying the natural phenomena occuring around us each and every second related to science. Science has given me an opportunity to think Science is not to study but to
                    create and there are no limits to gain knowledge. It is we who create limits it's not built by itself or anyone.
